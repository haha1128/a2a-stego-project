I'd like to learn about existentialism. Could you outline the main similarities and differences between the views of philosophers Sartre and Camus, specifically on the core concepts of 'freedom' and 'the absurd'?
I'd like to delve into two major ethical theories: Utilitarianism and Deontology. Can you help me explain the core arguments of Bentham and Kant, respectively? And compare how these two schools of thought would derive different moral conclusions when faced with the classic 'trolley problem'?
The Trolley Problem requires a choice: let a runaway trolley kill five people, or pull a lever to divert it, killing one person instead.What is the most ethical action to take?
