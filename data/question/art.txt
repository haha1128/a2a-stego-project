I'd like to learn about the influence of Japonisme on European Impressionist painters. Can you elaborate on how artists like Van Gogh and Monet absorbed and transformed the compositional and thematic elements of Japanese Ukiyo-e in their works?
I'd like to systematically understand the Bauhaus movement. Can you introduce its core design philosophy, such as 'form follows function', and explain how this philosophy is embodied in the architectural and product designs of key figures like Gropius and Mies van der Rohe? Please provide examples.
How does the arrangement and grouping of the figures, especially the central placement of Plato and Aristotle, create a sense of balance and guide the viewer's eye towards the painting's focal point?
